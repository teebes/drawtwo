You MUST run all commands inside Docker, not on host.
You should create all frontend views and files using Typescript rather than Javascript (unless there's a very good reason not to)
When designing frontend screens, refer to frontend/src/views/DesignReference.vue for style guidelines.
When I ask questions, don't automatically agree with my premises, or assume that my initial approach is correct. Think from first principles and push back if you think there's a better way.
